# Student Class Management System Program

This program was created for the course, CIS-2430 (Object Oriented Programming), taught by Professor Fei Song at the University of Guelph 
in the Fall 2021 semester. 

This program simulates a Student Class Management System that allows an instructor to analyze their class (data entry, searching via hashmap keys, calculating grades, and file I/O to input and display data). This program is demonstrated by a GUI (implemented using Java Swing and AWT packages).
